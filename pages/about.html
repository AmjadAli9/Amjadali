                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>It all began on **December 11, 2003**, when I was born in the bustling city of Hyderabad, India. My family consists of five members, and as the youngest, I've always held a special place in their hearts. Growing up, I was adored and given the freedom to explore my interests, whether it was diving into a new book, experimenting with my first laptop, or getting lost in the world of video games.  
                <p> Being the “cool kid” in the family, I often found myself in the role of the icebreaker during family gatherings and celebrations. My infectious laughter and knack for making jokes kept the atmosphere light and joyous, creating cherished memories with my relatives. I remember the time I tried to imitate Bollywood dance moves with my cousin, only to be met with a mix of laughter and applause—a moment that encapsulated my playful spirit. 
                <p>However, behind the jokes and laughter, I’ve always understood the importance of responsibility. My parents instilled in me the value of standing on my own two feet. I learned to help out with household chores, like assisting my mother in the kitchen, trying to make my signature dishes . I also took pride in my ability to handle small family errands, such as running to the local store to grab some groceries, a task that often turned into a mini-adventure, filled with bargaining with shopkeepers and chatting with neighbors. 
                <p>Like many typical Indian kids, my childhood was marked by a love for cricket. The weekends were spent playing matches with my friends in the narrow lanes of our neighborhood, armed with makeshift wickets and a tennis ball. My parents encouraged this love for sports. I also embraced the cultural richness around me—celebrating **Eid** with delicious biryani, and sweets and each festival weaving a thread into the tapestry of my upbringing. 
                <p>Through these experiences, I not only nurtured my playful side but also cultivated resilience, empathy, and a deep appreciation for family. The love and support I received have shaped my journey, teaching me to balance joy and responsibility as I continue to grow and pursue my passions..</p>
